/*
You are lost in Amman and need directions. You talk to a few strangers
and get these directions: go "NORTH", then "SOUTH", then "WEST", then "EAST", then "EAST".

Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too. 
Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction is a needless effort.

Your task is to look at the directions and eliminate all unnecessary moves.
In this case, you will just go EAST.

Another example:

plan = ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].

You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and then "SOUTH" is not reasonable, 
better stay where you are. So the task is to find a simplified version of the plan. 

A better plan in this case is simply: 
plan = ["WEST"]

You have to write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings 
and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed.

More examples:

dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"]) => ["WEST"]
dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH"]) => [] //don't need to move at all
*/

var dirReduc = function(directions){
	for (var i = 0; i < directions.length; i++) {
		if(directions[i] === "NORTH" && directions[i+1] === "SOUTH"){
			directions.splice(i+1,1)
			directions.splice(i,1)
			i=-1;
		} else if(directions[i] === "SOUTH" && directions[i+1] === "NORTH"){
			directions.splice(i+1,1)
			directions.splice(i,1)
			i=-1;
		} else if(directions[i] === "EAST" && directions[i+1] === "WEST"){
			directions.splice(i+1,1)
			directions.splice(i,1)
			i=-1;
		} else if(directions[i] === "WEST" && directions[i+1] === "EAST"){
			directions.splice(i+1,1)
			directions.splice(i,1)
			i=-1;
		} 
	}
	return directions;
};
